    "In this exercise you should write some code that approximates the function $f(x) = x + 2x^2 - exp(-x)$ for $x\\in[-3,3]$. You should define a function `q1(n)`, where `n` is the number of interpolation points. You should use an approximation of degree `deg=n-1`, and you should set `n=15` Chebyshev interpolation nodes.\n",

    "Redo exercise 1 with the `ApproxFun.jl` package. This should go into function `q2(n::Number)`, where now `n` is a positive number that will be used to define a symmetric interval around zero. So, you give `n=4`, you create $[-4,4]$ with `ApproxFun`.\n",
